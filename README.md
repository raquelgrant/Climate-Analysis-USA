# Climate Analysis USA

This repository draws on analyzing temperature changes throughout the seasons in the continental United States using information from The Washington Post's "2Â°C: Beyond the Limit."
 
### Where did the contents of this repository come from?

- This data was retrieved from a *Washington Post* repository for a study done using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Divisional Database (colloquially, nClimDiv). The study was performed in 2018 and then refined in 2019.
   > This was accessed through another *GitHub* page that can be found [here](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-2C-beyond-the-limit-usa).
- The original repository also contained temperature change data for specific counties in the states and national yearly temperature averages from 1895 to 2019.
- Using *Google Colaboratory* (a notebook service used for simple coding), I filtered the original dataset into a smaller more specific set of information. 

### What *are* the contents of this repository?

-  A CSV file of the original dataset displaying the temperature changes through all 4 seasons, the maximum warming season, the annual temperature changes, and the states represented
-  A CSV file of my filtered data set only displaying the winter and annual temperature changes with their respective states
- The Python notebook I created for replication that specifically describes the steps I took to create the new subset of data  
- The two choropleth maps I created to visualize the data.
